# ESPHome-Duepi
The Duepi EVO climate platform is a reverse engineered implementation of the app which is controlling Pellet stove heaters using a Duepi Evo Wifi module. With this module it is possible to control your pellet stove with **HomeAssistant**. This is in no way associated with the company Duepi and comes with no guarantees or warranty. Use at your own risk.
